## What is DOT Drug Testing?

DOT drug testing is required for employees in **safety‑sensitive** positions (e.g., CDL drivers). The program’s goal is to help ensure public safety by confirming workers are **not impaired by prohibited substances** while performing duties.

## The Five-Panel Drug Screen

DOT uses a standard five‑panel screen to detect categories of controlled substances:
- **Marijuana (THC)**
- **Cocaine**
- **Amphetamines** (e.g., amphetamine, methamphetamine)
- **Opiates** (e.g., heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone)
- **Phencyclidine (PCP)**

> Note: DOT requirements and cutoff levels are defined in **49 CFR Part 40** and related guidance. Always verify current rules before publishing or policy updates.

## When is Testing Required?

Common DOT circumstances include:
- **Pre‑employment** — before performing safety‑sensitive functions.  
- **Random** — unannounced selections throughout the year.  
- **Post‑accident** — when specific criteria are met (e.g., fatality, medical treatment away from scene, or disabling damage).  
- **Reasonable suspicion** — based on **specific, contemporaneous, articulable** observations by a trained supervisor.  
- **Return‑to‑duty (RTD)** — after a violation, prior to resuming safety‑sensitive work.  
- **Follow‑up** — unannounced testing after RTD per SAP’s plan.

## Why is DOT Drug Testing Important?

- **Safety:** Reduces impairment‑related risk and improves decision‑making on the job.  
- **Compliance:** Satisfies federal mandates for regulated transportation employers and workers.  
- **Productivity:** A well‑run program can lower absenteeism and turnover while improving reliability and morale.

## Types of DOT Drug Tests

- **Pre‑Employment** — must be negative before starting safety‑sensitive duties.  
- **Random** — scientifically valid selection methods; every covered employee has an equal chance.  
- **Post‑Accident** — triggered by qualifying events/criteria.  
- **Reasonable Suspicion** — based on trained supervisor observations (appearance, behavior, speech, odors).  
- **Return‑to‑Duty** — required after a violation; result must be negative before returning.  
- **Follow‑Up** — unannounced tests after RTD per SAP’s schedule.

## DOT Drug Testing Procedures

**Collection:** At an approved site, identity is verified; specimens are collected, sealed, and shipped.  
**Laboratory:** Split‑specimen (Vial A/B) testing; confirmatory testing if initial screen is positive.  
**Medical Review Officer (MRO):** Reviews lab results; may interview the employee and consider valid prescriptions.  
**Consequences:** Positive results remove the employee from safety‑sensitive duties; RTD and **follow‑up** testing are required per SAP guidance.

## Tips for Preparing for a DOT Drug Test

- **Understand the process:** Know what happens at the collection site and your rights/responsibilities.  
- **Check substances carefully:** Some products (e.g., CBD) may contain more THC than labeled and risk a positive test.  
- **Communicate appropriately:** Disclose relevant prescriptions to the MRO; verify company policy on medications.

## Conclusion

A compliant DOT drug testing program protects the public, supports a safer workplace, and helps employers meet federal obligations. Regular reviews of policy, supervisor training, and adherence to **49 CFR Part 40** keep programs effective and current.

## FAQs

**What regulation governs DOT testing?**  
**49 CFR Part 40** sets the procedures for DOT‑required drug and alcohol testing.

**What happens after a verified positive?**  
The employer must immediately remove the employee from safety‑sensitive duties. A **SAP** evaluation and RTD process follow, plus unannounced **follow‑up** testing.
